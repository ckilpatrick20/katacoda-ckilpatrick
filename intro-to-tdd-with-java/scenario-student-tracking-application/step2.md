Congratulations! We've written our first test.

## StudentTest.java

Let's complete the first stage of TDD by running our test. We are expecting this test to fail, or be <span style="color:red">red</span>.
### Run your first test <span style="color:red">(RED STAGE)</span>

Type the following command into the consule to run our first test:

`bash ./gradlew test`{{execute}}

### Failure
<span style="color:red">BUILD FAILED</span>

This is exactly what we were expecting. The `student.displayStudentFullName` method does not exist yet which means this test should and will fail.

Now you're ready for the part everyone loves, making the test go <span style="color:green">green</span>! Click continue when you're ready to move on to the next step.
